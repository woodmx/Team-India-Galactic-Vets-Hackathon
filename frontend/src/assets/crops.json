Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns.\n\n The other two types are \n\n2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season.",
